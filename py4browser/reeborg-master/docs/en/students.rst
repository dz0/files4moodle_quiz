Reeborg's World has been designed for you!


When Reeborg's World was created, half on my focus was on writing tutorials,
in both English and French, teaching programming.  Over time, I found that
other teachers were writing better tutorials and that my time was better
spent on improving the site, including adding new features.

Hopefully, you have a teacher or a friend or a parent to guide you and
help you learn Python (or Javascript) using Reeborg's World.
If you don't, all is not lost.

The current documentation contains all the basic information ... but
is not written in an easy way to help beginners learn.
You can try to follow some old tutorials I wrote,
[http://reeborg.ca/docs/begin_py_en/, http://reeborg.ca/docs/oop_py_en/,
http://reeborg.ca/docs/begin_py_fr/], the first two written in English and the
third written in French.  However, many of the worlds described do not
exist anymore - so you might have to create your own.  Feel free
to contact me, either by email, or by asking questions on a subreddit
I created a while ago (http://www.reddit.com/r/reeborg) and which has
been kept mostly hidden.

I know of some other tutorials that were written for the "old" version
of Reeborg's World.  When teachers contact me to tell me about their
tutorials adapted for the "new" version, I will list those tutorials
here so that you can use them for your own learning.
